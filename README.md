Instructions to run:
1. Clone repo / Download zip and extract
2. Open terminal in root folder (the folder with this readme file), and type: 'cd robo-sim' then 'py robosim' (without the quotes)
3. In the simulator, open File > Load Scenery, open scenery folder, and load 'maze2015a.scm' or 'maze2015b.scm' or 'maze2015c.scm' or 'maze2015d.scm'
4. Open new terminal in root folder, and type the following: 'make' then './final'

NOTE: If using Windows, you need to use Cygwin (https://www.cygwin.com/) and copy the files there. cmd and PowerShell does NOT work.
